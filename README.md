# overlayTranslation

An application that will overlay 2 sections of text. The inspiration behind this application is to be able to read in one language a revert back to another translation. 


## My thought behind it
Languages tend to be translated sentence by sentence. I wanted a way of being able to read a text and revert back to a translation at any point (by tapping the sentence). This would definitly help with learning a language.


## How it works
V0.1 - Intially a web application. 
      - user inputs a string
      - user inputs another string
      - the strings are seperated into arrays. (a way of indexing sentences)
      - the user selects usermode
      - the user can tap on a sentence to see the corresponding sentence in 2nd string
